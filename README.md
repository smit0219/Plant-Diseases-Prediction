# Plant-Diseases-Prediction
This project aims to create a machine learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), that can classify different types of potato leaf diseases. The data used for training the model comes from the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of potato leaves affected by different diseases, as well as healthy leaves.
